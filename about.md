Hey there! This is Yajing :) 

I just started a PhD at Paris-Saclay University in the field of Natural language processing. The subject on which I'll be working during the three following years is "Multimodal Representations & Assessments of Fluctuations in the Mood of Speakers in Speech". My research interests lies in NLP, affective computing, speech signal processing and multimodality etc. Generally I'm just a curious person. 

I'll share my research experiences with you here. Besides, I'm working on music composition during my spare time, so you might surprisingly find some pieces here later ;)
