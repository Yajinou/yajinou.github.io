This is Yajing, a constantly curious person.

I recently started a PhD at Paris-Saclay University in the field of Natural language processing. The subject on which I'll be working during the three following years is "Multimodal Representations & Assessments of Fluctuations in the Mood of Speakers in Speech". My research interests lies in NLP, affective computing, speech signal processing and multimodality etc. 

I'll share with you in this blog my research experiences, as well as some casual thoughts. Besides, I'm working on music composition during my spare time, so you might surprisingly find some pieces here later ;)
